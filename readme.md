# StarWars RPG  

While not the most challenging of recent projects it sill proved interesting. Short of animations or add / remove mothods I hadn't conisdered moving elements around a page via jquery as was done here via `appendTo`  

I often utilize arrays for different purposes but I opted for an object of this project. Doing so allowed me to dynamically generate the character blocks with an index tribute which combine with moving between elements provided a means to track the choices and all the numbers. Needless to say some variables were also needed to simplify some of the functions and data pulls from the object.
